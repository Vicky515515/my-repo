Hello again. My name is Sophie Dove.

1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,750
Previously, I gave you the lecture on nutrients. My plan today

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,800
is to introduce you to a few classic types of

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,150
experimental designs that are associated with identifying the influence

4
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,890
of a factor on a given response either

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:27,490
as part of a field study or associated with a manipulative experiment.

6
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:34,550
I will begin by introducing you to a few key terms and concepts.

7
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,600
Why do we conduct experiments?

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,329
Typically because we want to  precisely

9
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,870
and accurately answer some specific question or

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,039
questions. The answer usually involves

11
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,699
observing the impact of a treatment on a group

12
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:59,390
or collection of subjects. Prior to engaging in any experiment

13
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,510
it is important to identify known

14
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:07,790
or expected sources of variability as this will improve precision

15
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,830
and minimize bias. Professor Hoegh-Guldberg

16
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,630
spoke about precision in his field methods lecture

17
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,590
but it is clear that bias has to be eliminated

18
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,830
if the answers obtained to questions are to

19
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,119
overlap with the correct or true answers:

20
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,049
the truth. The following schematic

21
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:32,369
is intended to help you understand these terms

22
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,790
and their relationship to each other. Observations

23
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:42,000
are precise and accurate if they are closely clustered

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,810
and overlap the truth. Observations are

25
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,810
inaccurate but precise if they are closely clustered

26
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:56,130
but don&#39;t approximate the truth. They can be

27
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,409
accurate and imprecise when they overlap the truth

28
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:04,180
but are not closely clustered and they can be both

29
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,660
inaccurate and imprecise.

30
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,940
Clearly a key goal must be to eliminate bias

31
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:16,209
and improve precision. A step essential to this goal

32
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:20,209
is to ensure that background conditions are uniform across

33
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:25,090
all the treatments applied to all the experimental subjects.

34
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,879
Talking about &quot;treatments&quot; requires the introduction of a few more technical terms.

35
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,330
A factor is essentially a category

36
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,630
or type of treatment. Sometimes they are referred to as

37
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:47,480
&quot;controlled independent variables&quot; or &quot;categorical variables.&quot;

38
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,019
Here the application or presence of nutrients

39
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,170
is given as an example of a factor.

40
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,269
Factors have levels,

41
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:01,480
that is, the different amounts of the factor

42
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,940
that you are going to dose the experimental subjects with.

43
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,300
In this case there are three levels:

44
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,349
low, mid, high concentrations of nutrients.

45
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:17,129
Experimental designs can include

46
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:20,290
more than one factor. Therefore

47
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,370
the design of the experiment may be referred to

48
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,150
as a one factorial, two factorial

49
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,450
three factorial and so on experiment.

50
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,920
A factor is fixed when the levels under study

51
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,430
are the only levels of interest. A factor is random

52
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,629
when the levels under study are a random

53
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:47,920
sample from a larger population and the goal of the study

54
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,030
is to make a statement regarding the larger

55
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,980
population. Another way of understanding this

56
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,080
is that, if the level studied

57
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,360
divided by the levels of interest is equal to one

58
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,580
then the factor is fixed. If it is less than one

59
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,739
then the factor is random. Typically

60
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:16,100
the sex of an animal will be a fixed factor the levels studied

61
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,329
are male and female and for the most part

62
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:25,500
these are the only levels available, whilst the genotype of an animal

63
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,820
will be a random factor. You might select

64
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,990
to examine four genotypes from a population

65
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,800
that may include thousands of distinct genotypes.

66
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,360
If you recall Professor Hoegh-Guldberg

67
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,070
suggested that you add replicate experimental areas

68
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,270
to augment the level of replication in your experiment

69
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,050
and hence improve your ability to associate

70
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:55,070
responses with the different treatments, as opposed to mere inter-site

71
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,110
differences irrespective of the treatment.

72
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,630
For such an experimental design

73
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,220
the question is: are polluted sites different

74
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,620
from non-polluted control sites? The hypothesis would be:

75
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,630
polluted and controlled means for a specific response variable

76
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:21,900
are different. A description of the experimental design will be given as follows:

77
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,270
this is one factorial design where the factor

78
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,520
is habitat studied at two levels -

79
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,910
polluted and control - with three replicate

80
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,639
measurements determined for each level of the factor.

81
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,060
The factor is fixed because there are only two levels of interest for the

82
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,960
factor as we are not concerned with different amounts

83
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,039
of pollution in the present question just

84
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,500
presence and absence of pollution.

85
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,720
An alternative and commonly used approach that requires slightly more work

86
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,860
includes replicated transits within each

87
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,530
experimental area, in this case the question is slightly more complex

88
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,069
and asks: are the sites within a habitat

89
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:12,080
more similar to each other than the sites

90
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,759
between habitats? We can compare

91
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,310
amongst the experimental areas because we have more than a single transect for

92
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:25,280
each area. The hypothesis is then

93
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,690
that, the response variable - for example

94
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:33,590
abundance of sea cucumbers - will vary between habitats

95
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,569
and that differences will be greater than differences observed

96
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:41,180
on a smaller spatial scale.

97
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,000
It is a two factorial nested experimental design

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,380
the first factor is habitat with two levels,

99
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,870
polluted and controlled as before, we now

100
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,199
however, have a second factor - site -

101
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,810
with three separate levels or locations.

102
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,840
Habitat is fixed as before but site it random

103
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,180
because there are more than three locations we could have

104
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,319
selected from for each habitat level.

105
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,900
The nested approach is necessary becuase the same site can not be used

106
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,580
for both polluted

107
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,169
and control habitats. Again

108
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:27,479
this is a nested design because not all the boxes can be filled with data

109
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,240
when we tabulate the responses observed,

110
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,539
for example site one cannot be found

111
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:38,970
both in the control habitat and in the polluted habitat,

112
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,680
as a site can not be both polluted and clean

113
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,819
at the same time. When we select sites

114
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:50,310
amongst possible options it is important that we check that any differences

115
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,139
obtained

116
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,349
isolate our specific question from other

117
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:59,620
background conditions that may lead to obtaining significant differences that

118
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,810
actually have nothing to do with our specific question.

119
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:10,289
River plumes extend into significant portions of the Great Barrier Reef

120
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:13,740
following large rainfall.

121
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,379
A question that we might like to ask then is:

122
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:21,050
do the river plumes affect the distribution and abundance

123
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,470
of benthic coral reef organisms?

124
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,319
To assist with this aim, we might like to download satellite

125
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,180
image data that determines where the plumes extend to

126
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,519
within the Great Barrier Reef. Logically

127
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,659
the inshore because it is closer to the mouth of rivers,

128
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,850
is likely to be more affected than the offshore.

129
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,560
But if you select inshore reefs as &quot;plume affected&quot;

130
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,250
and offshore reefs as &quot;not affected&quot; it is possible

131
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,519
that non-plume effects drive any outcomes observed.

132
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,510
For example, upwelling and cooler water

133
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:04,260
may affect the offshore as opposed to the inshore reefs.

134
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:10,110
Likewise if you select your plume-affected sites from just the northern regions

135
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,910
and your plume-unaffected sites from the southern regions,

136
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:19,700
again these distinct latitudinal regions come with long-term differences

137
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,200
in temperature profiles. As much as possible

138
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,690
you need to select sites that eliminate these confounding background

139
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,010
features.

140
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,279
Here I hope to find satellite images

141
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,880
that would show the plume extending to the red sites

142
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,660
but not to the yellow sites, however this may not always be possible.

143
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,550
Furthermore your interest in river plumes may be tied

144
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,010
to the effects of either the nutrients or salinity

145
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,450
or sediment or pesticide concentrations

146
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,890
on the subject. However

147
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,279
it may not be possible to find sites in the field

148
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,480
that isolate these different drivers but otherwise have similar background

149
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,540
features. This is where manipulative experiments come into their own.

150
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,019
This brings us to the end of part one

151
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:17,089
of this lecture. In part two we will begin to take

152
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:20,920
a look at a design that is often used in manipulative

153
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,209
experiements to tease apart the roles

154
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:27,390
of different drivers or factors.

155
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:27,709
Thank you.
